**Controlling the position of elements**

*Building Blocks :CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-levelbox or an inline box.*

*Containing Elements :If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.*

**Controlling the Position of Elements**

*CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the positionproperty in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.*
*To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed. (You will meet these when we introduce the positioning schemes on the following pages.)*
